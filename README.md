# ctos-welcome
A welcome Dialog for Coopertronic OS. This is to give the new user help on different areas.

## Overview

I have used a video from DistroTube that has helped kickstart my journey into ArchISO builds. The video I used for this app is: [Creating Your Own Qt Applications...It's Easy!](https://youtu.be/WTb99Rd3Vu0?si=Fd9sFzD2sI4mXMnH)

It is very easy when you get into the nuts and bolts. I have 9 buttons that will take the user to different resources or open different apps in the system to help the new user along the way.

### Creation notes

I have created a basic dialog, but this needs to be a main window. I will now:

- Create the app in a main windows
- Use dialog windows to view videos and other media that will be used for app.
- I will add heading labels to the button columns.
- I will change the button manes to reflect something I can understand in the code.
